# Expense Management System

## Overview
This C program serves as an expense management system, allowing users to add, delete, and track expenses among multiple users. It features a user-friendly interface and efficient algorithms for user lookup.

## Features
- **User Management:**
  - Add new users with a unique User ID, name, and initial amount spent.
  - Delete existing users, ensuring all balances are settled before removal.

- **Expense Tracking:**
  - Add expenses with a unique Expense ID, amount, and the user who paid.
  - Specify users sharing the expense, dynamically updating their balances.

- **Balance Calculation:**
  - Calculate and display amounts owed and to be paid by each user.
  - Enable users to settle balances, updating amounts accordingly.

- **Efficient User Lookup:**
  - Utilize a binary search algorithm for quick and efficient user retrieval by User ID.

## Getting Started
1. **Compilation:**
   - Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
   ```bash
   gcc expense_management.c -o expense_management
1. **Execution:**
   - Run the compiled executable.
    ```bash
    ./expense_management
3. **Usage:**
    - Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various operations (add users, add expenses, check balances, settle amounts, etc.).

## Important Notes
Ensure that the C compiler is installed on your system.
The program uses a binary search algorithm, so user IDs in the database should be sorted for efficient searching.
Validate user inputs, especially when adding expenses and users, to avoid unexpected behavior.
